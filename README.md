# Data-Analysis-With-SQL-Queries
In my Pizza Sales project, I use SQL to explore a database of pizza orders. I answer important business questions by calculating total revenue, finding the best and worst-selling pizzas, and discovering ordering trends throughout the week. This analysis helps understand what customers like and how to improve sales.
